/** \page apf APF

APF (Attached Parallel Fields) is a library of finite element simulation
abstractions, including Fields and Meshes.

- The API for mesh queries is in apfMesh.h, especially apf::Mesh
- The API for mesh modification is in apfMesh2.h, especially apf::Mesh2
- The API for fields is in apf.h
- Field types and shape functions are in apfShape.h
- The API for numberings is in apfNumbering.h
- The API for fixed-size linear algebra is in apfVector.h and apfMatrix.h
- The API for runtime-sized linear algebra is in apfDynamicVector.h and
  apfDynamicMatrix.h
- The API for partitioning is in apfPartition.h, see also parma.h
- Useful data structures can be found in
  canArray.h, canNew.h, and canDynamicArray.h
- When coding operations on groups of elements in parallel,
  consider using the \subpage cavity.
- The API for mesh conversion is in apfConvert.h
